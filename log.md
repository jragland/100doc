# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Setup a couple of initial repositories on github and then got my local system configured to use ssh with github. In an effort to have "somethign" to work with, I searched for a 'todo list' app on github and stumbled across the following:

**Link(s) to research**: [Todo List](https://github.com/cassidoo/todometer)

**Thoughts**: I have been wanting to do this for a while, but ive been hesitant to just start. Changing that today. Guess we will se what comes of this. The following are links to the inital repos that I am going to use for this. [100doc] will be used to log my learning and growth, [TestingWorld] will be used to hold various tests or experimentations I want to work with

### Day 1: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Started today with changing the default branches in both of my new repos to 'main' instead of using 'master'. Next, I gave some thought to the 'todo' app that I got yesterday.

**Thoughts**: The conversation around the topic of 'master' is something that I am still working through. However, I feel its a good practice to get away from the 'master'/'slave' terminologies in techology as there have always been better ways to describe the functions those terms were used for. I went into github and also set the default for my account to use as 'main'. Off to start my day, will work on this more later today.

I am not sure how I am going to use the todo list jsut yet. I am thinking of just running it via a random, one-off, docker host ec2 instance. I guess ill get that going and see if its a viable solution for a to-do app.

### Day 2: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time working on my docker container. I work with containes daily, but having to build them is something new to me. Most of today has been just getting my Dockerfile to do what I want/need. Feeling slightly more comfortable with the docker CLI, just need to memorize the commands better

**Thoughts**: Docker versus Containerd is something I keep thinking about. Not sure if there is really a point to differentiate between the two, but with all the things happening with Docker over the last year, I cant help but wonder if Containerd is the better technology to work with.
